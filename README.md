Summary of EDA on Banking Dataset

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided meaningful insights into customer demographics, banking behavior, and factors influencing decisions. The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and analyzed to identify patterns, correlations, and trends.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed duplicates to ensure accuracy.

Customer Demographics: Analyzed age, job type, marital status, and education distribution to understand customer profiles.

Banking Behavior: Studied variables like account balance, previous campaign outcome, and loan status to detect spending and saving habits.

Target Variable Analysis: Focused on whether customers subscribed to term deposits. Compared subscription rates across different demographic and financial groups.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Used histograms, bar charts, and boxplots to visualize distribution and relationships. Identified factors like age group, job type, and balance as key drivers.

Correlation Analysis: Checked relationships among numerical variables such as age, balance, duration, and campaign calls. Duration of last contact showed strong influence on subscription outcome.

Key Insights:

Middle-aged customers with higher balances were more likely to subscribe.

Customers with housing loans were less likely to opt for term deposits.

Education level and job type significantly impacted subscription probability.

Fewer campaign calls with higher contact duration led to better conversion rates.
